# Meeting 1 - Tuesday September 28 from 15-16.
Please complete the following steps prior to attending rSTARS

* Install R. You can do that [here](https://www.r-project.org/)
* Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Open RStudio at least once, to see if it is working

On this meeeting, we will get hands-on experience with creating reproducible research outputs in R markdown. Thus, the programme for the first meeting is:

+ Creating and setting up a reasonable Rmarkdown workflow
+ Introduction to templates. We will use the bookdown::pdf_document2 template. Specifically, we will work with basics
    - Inserting figures/tables 
    - Cross-referencing figures and reporting estimates from models in main text in an automatised.
    - Citations
+ Initial work with data wrangling and visualization. We will use data from Tidy Tuesday (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday#readme) and work with our data in R Markdown.
+ If there is time, I hope that someone would be willing to do an introduction to Github and version control.

# Meeting 2: Tuesday October 5 from 15-16
Now that we are all set and pro users of R Markdown, we will allocate more time to working with datasets from [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Furthermore, we'll have an introduction from [Tobias Widmann](https://twitter.com/TobiasWidmann) on how to make your own webpage in R Markdown through a couple of simple steps. Take a look at his awesome [page](https://tobiaswidmann.eu/)

# Meeting 3: Tuesday October 12 from 15-16
TBA. When I was a kid, there was this children's TV show called "Bugs Bunnys Sunday Club". Every sunday they awarded the prize ["Granny of the week"](https://underholdning.tv2.dk/kendte/2015-07-16-nostalgi-husker-du-klassikerne-fra-snurre-snups-soendagsklub) and every time the granny was praised for being so kind to their grandchildren and made their life better. I think, we should do something similar in rSTARS - perhaps "R function of the week" where people do a very short presentation on a simple, but great function that made their life better. Obvious themes could be

1. Regressing/plotting multiple models for exploratory analysis
2. Creating awesome regression/descriptive tables
3. All sorts of loops.

# Meeting 4: Tuesday October 19
TBA.
