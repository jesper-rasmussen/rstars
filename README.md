Welcome to R Markdown STudy group Accommodating Reproducible Science - better known as rSTARS! This study group is open for anyone who wish to improve a) their skills in data wrangling on different forms of data, b) data visualization, and c) creating reproducible research outputs in R Markdown. 

## Expectations and disclaimers

* We meet on Tuesdays from 15-16 on a weekly basis in 1341-315. The capacity of the room is 24. 
* Each week we will work on some dataset, learn to do efficient data wrangling, create awesome visualizations and make it all reproducible
* **Most importantly**: It is not a course, itâ€™s an environment where we sit together and work, help and inspire each other.
* There is no preparation. Just show up!
* There will be people on all levels. By creating this environment less experienced R stars can benefit from more experienced R stars, while the latter can benefit from connecting to peers at their level.
* I will regularly update [the rSTARS github repository](https://github.com/jesper-rasmussen/rstars) which contains useful templates

## Rules
There are two rules in rSTARS.

1. The first rule of rSTARS is: You do not create irreproducible research outputs
2. The second rule of rSTARS is: You do **not** create irreproducible research outputs

## Core resources
There are (too) many more or less useful resources for getting started with R and R Markdown. 8 months in, here are a couple of my favorites!

* [R 4 Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html): (Almost) everything you need to do political (data) science as a newbie.
* [R Markdown - The definitive guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/): Clean, simple startup guide on R Markdown
* [Statistical tools for high-throughput data analysis](http://www.sthda.com/english/): Ugly website, but extremly useful! Great for basic inspiration on data wrangling and visualization. Use the search function!
* [Data visualization](https://socviz.co/): This is a fantastic introduction to visualization by [Kiearan Healy](https://twitter.com/kjhealy). Use it! Also take a look at his course on [data wrangling](https://github.com/kjhealy/data_wrangling) with accompanying code.
* [R Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) - here you can find cheatsheets (read: help sheets) for everything. At first, I didn't knew what to do with these, but once you crack the code they will improve your quality of life with atleast 0.37 standard deviation!
    + [Base R](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/base-r.pdf)
    + [R Markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
    + Data Transformartion with [dplyr](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-transformation.pdf)
    + Data Vizualization with [ggplot2](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)

### Research outputs
Here are some of my favorite packages to generate research output

* PDF and HTML documents - specify in YAML: [bookdown::pdf_document2](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/a-single-document.html)
* Regression tables and descriptives: Use [Modelsummary](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/articles/modelsummary.html). Take a look at [this beautiful descriptive table](https://twitter.com/Kunkakom/status/1444328826251759617?s=20) from [Alexander Wuttke](https://www.alexander-wuttke.de/)

# Meeting 1 - Tuesday October 5 from 15-16.
**Prior to the first meeting**

Please complete the following steps prior to attending rSTARS

* Install R. You can do that [here](https://www.r-project.org/)
* Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Open RStudio at least once, to see if it is working
