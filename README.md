Welcome to R Markdown STudy Group Accomodating Reproducible Science - better known as rSTARS! This study group is open for anyone who wish to improve a) their skills in data wrangling on different forms of data, b) data visualization, and c) creating reproducible research outputs in R Markdown. 

## Expectations and disclaimers

* We meet on Tuesdays from 15-16 on a weekly basis in 1341-315. The capacity of the room is 24. 
* Each week we will work on some dataset, learn to do efficient data wrangling, create awesome visualizations and make it all reproducible
* **Most importantly**: It is not a course, it's an environment where we sit together and work, help and inspire each other. 
* There is no preparation. Just show up!
* There will be people on all levels. By creating this environment less expierienced R stars can befinit from more expierienced R stars, whil the latter can benefit from conencting to peers at their level.

## Rules
There are two rules in rSTARS.

1. The first rule of rSTARS is: You do not create irreproducible research output
2. The second rule of rSTARS is: You do **not** create irreproducible research output

## Core resources
There are (too) many more or less useful resources for getting started with R and R Markdown. 8 months in, here are a couple of my favorites!

* [R 4 Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html): (Almost) everything you need to do political (data) science as a newbie.
* [R Markdown - The definitive guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/): Clean, simple startup guide on R Markdown
* [Statistical tools for high-throughput data analysis](http://www.sthda.com/english/): Ugly website, but extremly useful! Great for basic inspiration on data wrangling and visualization. Use the search function!
* [R Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) - here you can find cheatsheets (read: help sheets) for everything. At first, I didn't knew what to do with these, but once you crack the code they will improve your quality of life with atleast 0.37 standard deviation!
    + [Base R](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/base-r.pdf)
    + [R Markdown](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)
    + Data Transformartion with [dplyr](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-transformation.pdf)
    + Data Vizualization with [ggplot2](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)

# Meeting 1 - Tuesday September 28 from 15-16.
**Prior to the first meeting**
Please complete the following steps prior to attending rSTARS

* Install R. You can do that [here](https://www.r-project.org/)
* Install [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Open RStudio at least once, to see if it is working


**Schedule**
On this meeeting, we will get hands-on experience with creating reproducible research outputs in R markdown. Thus, the programme for the first meeting is:

+ Creating and setting up a reasonable Rmarkdown workflow
+ Introduction to templates. We will use the bookdown::pdf_document2 template. Specifically, we will work with basics
    - Inserting figures/tables 
    - Cross-referencing figures and reporting estimates from models in main text in an automatised.
    - Citations
+ Initial work with data wrangling and visualization. We will use data from [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday#readme) and work with our data in R Markdown.
+ If there is time, I hope that someone would be willing to do an introduction to Github and version control.
  
# Meeting 2: Tuesday October 5 from 15-16
Now that we are all set and pro users of R Markdown, we will allocate more time to working with datasets from [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). Furthermore, we'll have an introduction from [Tobias Widmann](https://twitter.com/TobiasWidmann) on how to make your own webpage in R Markdown through a couple of simple steps. Take a look at his awesome [page](https://tobiaswidmann.eu/)

# Meeting 3: Tuesday October 12 from 15-16
TBA. When I was a kid, there was this children's TV show called "Bugs Bunnys Sunday Club". Every sunday they awarded the prize ["Granny of the week"](https://underholdning.tv2.dk/kendte/2015-07-16-nostalgi-husker-du-klassikerne-fra-snurre-snups-soendagsklub) and every time the granny was praised for being so kind to their grandchildren and made their life better. I think, we should do something similar in rSTARS - perhaps "R function of the week" where people do a very short presentation on a simple, but great function that made their life better. Obvious themes could be

1. Regressing/plotting multiple models for exploratory analysis
2. Creating awesome regression/descriptive tables
3. All sorts of loops.

# Meeting 4: Tuesday October 19 from 15-16
TBA.
